# EKNetwork Roadmap & Improvement Plan

This document outlines the planned improvements and known issues for EKNetwork.

## 🎯 High Priority Issues

### Issue #1: Memory Leak in ProgressDelegate
**Status:** 🔴 Critical  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:729-731`

**Problem:** Creating a new `URLSession` with `ProgressDelegate` for each progress request can cause memory leaks.

**Solution:**
- Use a shared `URLSession` with a delegate manager
- Or explicitly invalidate session after request completion

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

### Issue #2: Force Unwrap in MultipartFormData
**Status:** 🟡 Medium  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:273-282`

**Problem:** Force unwrap (`!`) is used when converting strings to Data, which can cause crashes.

**Solution:**
- Use safe conversion with error handling
- Or use `Data(contentsOf:)` with validation

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### Issue #3: Race Condition in updateBaseURL
**Status:** 🟡 Medium  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:592-595`

**Problem:** The `updateBaseURL` method is not synchronized, which can cause race conditions.

**Solution:**
- Use `actor` or `NSLock` for synchronization
- Or make `NetworkManager` an actor

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

### Issue #4: Unsafe String(describing:) Usage in RetryPolicy
**Status:** 🟡 Medium  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:507-509`

**Problem:** Using `String(describing: type(of: $0))` for type checking is unreliable.

**Solution:**
- Use protocols to mark errors that shouldn't be retried
- Or use `is` for type checking

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

### Issue #5: Missing Task Cancellation Handling in Retry Logic
**Status:** 🟡 Medium  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:772-774`

**Problem:** Retry logic doesn't check if Task was cancelled, leading to unnecessary retries.

**Solution:**
- Add `Task.isCancelled` check before retry
- Throw `CancellationError` on cancellation

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

## 🟢 Low Priority Issues

### Issue #6: Missing URL Validation in updateBaseURL
**Status:** 🟢 Low  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:592-595`

**Problem:** The `updateBaseURL` method doesn't validate URL before setting.

**Solution:**
- Add URL validation
- Throw error on invalid URL

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

### Issue #7: Query Parameters Overwrite Issue
**Status:** 🟢 Low  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:632-634`

**Problem:** Existing query parameters in URL may be overwritten when adding new ones.

**Solution:**
- Check existing query parameters
- Merge them with new ones

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

### Issue #8: Missing Content-Length Validation for Stream
**Status:** 🟢 Low  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:691-695`

**Problem:** Content-Length is not set for streams, which may cause issues with some servers.

**Solution:**
- Document this behavior
- Or provide option to set Content-Length

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

### Issue #9: ProgressDelegate Task Cancellation
**Status:** 🟢 Low  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:807-809, 822-824, 830-832`

**Problem:** `Task { @MainActor in }` in `ProgressDelegate` may continue after request cancellation.

**Solution:**
- Check `Task.isCancelled` before updating
- Use `Task.checkCancellation()`

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---

### Issue #10: Empty Response Handler Validation
**Status:** 🟢 Low  
**Location:** `NetworkManager.swift:410-420`

**Problem:** Empty responses throw error even when they might be valid for some requests.

**Solution:**
- Improve documentation
- Or add option to allow empty responses

**Related Issue:** See GitHub issue for details

---
